[SMP support in the FreeRTOS Kernel](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/tree/smp) enables one instance of 
the FreeRTOS kernel to schedule tasks across multiple identical processor cores. 
The core architectures must be identical and share the same memory.

## Getting Started with FreeRTOS and SMP

The simplest way to get started is to use one of the following pre-configured
example projects:

* [XCORE AI](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/04-Demos/XMOS/smp-demo-for-xmos-xcore-ai-explorer-board)
* [Raspberry Pi Pico](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/04-Demos/Raspberry-Pi/smp-demos-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico-board)


## Modifying an Application to use FreeRTOS SMP Functionality

The FreeRTOS API remains substantially the same between single core and SMP versions except 
for [these additions](#smp-specific-apis). Therefore, an application written for the FreeRTOS single
core version should compile with the SMP version with minimal to no effort. However,
there may be some functional issues, as some assumptions which were true
for single core applications may no longer be true for multi-core applications.

One such common assumption is that a lower priority task cannot run while
a higher priority task is running. While this was true on a single core,
it is no longer true for multi-cores, as multiple tasks can be running
simultaneously. If the application relies on relative task priorities to provide
mutual exclusion, it may observe unexpected results in a multi-core environment.
The application writer has couple of options to address this:

1. The best option is to update the application so that it does not rely on task priorities
   and uses synchronization primitives instead.

2. Another option is to pin all the tasks which must not be running
   simultaneously to one core using the `vTaskCoreAffinitySet` API.

3. Another option is to define `configRUN_MULTIPLE_PRIORITIES` to `0` which
   ensures that multiple tasks will run simultaneously only if they have the same
   priority. Note that this may result in under utilization and put some cores to
   idle when they could be used to run other low priority tasks.

One other common assumption is that ISRs cannot run simultaneously with each other or with other tasks. 
This is no longer true in a multi-core environment and the application writer needs to ensure proper 
mutual exclusion while accessing data shared between tasks and ISRs. The macros `taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR()` 
and `taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR()` can be used in ISRs and the macros `taskENTER_CRITICAL()` 
and `taskEXIT_CRITICAL()` can be used in tasks to provide such mutual exclusion.


## SMP Specific APIs

These additional APIs are available to the FreeRTOS-SMP kernel:

* [vTaskCoreAffinitySet](#vtaskcoreaffinityset)
* [vTaskCoreAffinityGet](#vtaskcoreaffinityget)
* [vTaskPreemptionDisable](#vtaskpreemptiondisable)
* [vTaskPreemptionEnable](#vtaskpreemptionenable)


### vTaskCoreAffinitySet

```c
void vTaskCoreAffinitySet( const TaskHandle_t xTask, UBaseType_t uxCoreAffinityMask ); 
```

`configUSE_CORE_AFFINITY` must be defined as `1` for this function to be available.

Sets the core affinity mask for a task, i.e. the cores on which a task can run.

**Parameters:**

* `xTask` - The handle of the task that the core affinity mask is for. Passing `NULL`
  will set the core affinity mask for the calling task.

* `uxCoreAffinityMask` - A bitwise value that indicates the cores on which the task
  can run. Cores are numbered from `0` to `configNUM_CORES - 1`. For example, to ensure that a task
  can run on core `0` and core `1`, set `uxCoreAffinityMask` to `0x03`.


**Example Usage:**

```c
/* The function that creates task. */  
void vAFunction( void )  
{  
TaskHandle_t xHandle;  
UBaseType_t uxCoreAffinityMask;  

    /* Create a task, storing the handle. */  
    xTaskCreate( vTaskCode, "NAME", STACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY, &( xHandle ) );  

    /* Define the core affinity mask such that this task can only run on core 0  
     * and core 2. */  
    uxCoreAffinityMask = ( ( 1 << 0 ) | ( 1 << 2 ) );  

    /* Set the core affinity mask for the task. */  
    vTaskCoreAffinitySet( xHandle, uxCoreAffinityMask );  
}  
```


### vTaskCoreAffinityGet

```c
UBaseType_t vTaskCoreAffinityGet( const TaskHandle_t xTask ); 
```

`configUSE_CORE_AFFINITY` must be defined as `1` for this function to be available.

Gets the core affinity mask for a task, i.e. the cores on which a task can run.


**Parameters:**

* `xTask` - The handle of the task that the core affinity mask is for. Passing `NULL`
  will get the core affinity mask for the calling task.


**Returns:**

* The core affinity mask, which is a bitwise value that indicates the cores on
  which a task can run. Cores are numbered from `0` to `configNUM_CORES - 1`.
  For example, if a task can run on core `0` and core `1`, the core affinity mask
  is `0x03`.


**Example Usage:**

```c 
/* Task handle of the networking task - it is populated elsewhere. */  
TaskHandle_t xNetworkingTaskHandle;  

void vAFunction( void )  
{  
TaskHandle_t xHandle;  
UBaseType_t uxNetworkingCoreAffinityMask;  

    /* Create a task, storing the handle. */  
    xTaskCreate( vTaskCode, "NAME", STACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY, &( xHandle ) );  

    /* Get the core affinity mask for the networking task. */  
    uxNetworkingCoreAffinityMask = vTaskCoreAffinityGet( xNetworkingTaskHandle );  

    /* Here is a hypothetical scenario, just for the example. Assume that we  
     * have 2 cores - Core 0 and core 1. We want to pin the application task to  
     * the core that is not the networking task core to ensure that the  
     * application task does not interfere with networking. */  
    if( ( uxNetworkingCoreAffinityMask & ( 1 << 0 ) ) != 0 )  
    {  
        /* The networking task can run on core 0, pin our task to core 1. */  
        vTaskCoreAffinitySet( xHandle, ( 1 << 1 ) );  
    }  
    else  
    {  
        /* Otherwise, pin our task to core 0. */  
        vTaskCoreAffinitySet( xHandle, ( 1 << 0 ) );  
    }  
}  
```


### vTaskPreemptionDisable

```c
void vTaskPreemptionDisable( const TaskHandle_t xTask ); 
```

`configUSE_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE` must be defined as `1` for this function to be available.

Disables preemption for a task.


**Parameters:**

* `xTask` - The handle of the task for which preemption will be disabled. Passing
  `NULL` disables preemption for the calling task.


**Example Usage:**

```c
void vTaskCode( void *pvParameters )  
{  
    /* Silence warnings about unused parameters. */  
    ( void ) pvParameters;  

    for( ;; )  
    {  
        /* ... Perform some function here. */  

        /* Disable preemption for this task. */  
        vTaskPreemptionDisable( NULL );  

        /* The task will not be preempted when it is executing in this portion ... */  

        /* ... until the preemption is enabled again. */  

        vTaskPreemptionEnable( NULL );  

        /* The task can be preempted when it is executing in this portion. */  
    }  
}  
```


### vTaskPreemptionEnable

```c
void vTaskPreemptionEnable( const TaskHandle_t xTask ); 
```

`configUSE_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE` must be defined as `1` for this function to be available.

Enables preemption for a task.


**Parameters:**

* `xTask` - The handle of the task for which preemption will be enabled. Passing
  `NULL` enables preemption for the calling task.


**Example Usage:**

```c
void vTaskCode( void *pvParameters )  
{  
    /* Silence warnings about unused parameters. */  
    ( void ) pvParameters;  

    for( ;; )  
    {  
        /* ... Perform some function here. */  

        /* Disable preemption for this task. */  
        vTaskPreemptionDisable( NULL );  

        /* The task will not be preempted when it is executing in this portion ... */  

        /* ... until the preemption is enabled again. */  
        vTaskPreemptionEnable( NULL );  

        /* The task can be preempted when it is executing in this portion. */  
    }  
}  
```


## SMP Specific Hook Functions

### Minimal Idle Hook Function

The FreeRTOS SMP kernel has two type of Idle tasks:

1. Idle Task - There is the standard Idle task used in single core FreeRTOS applications.

2. Minimal Idle Tasks - There are `configNUM_CORES - 1` Minimal Idle tasks which
   are run on idle cores and which do nothing.

The minimal idle tasks can optionally call an application-defined hook
(or callback) function - the minimal idle hook. The minimal idle tasks run at
the very lowest priority, so such an idle hook function will only run
when there are no tasks of higher priority that are able to run.

The minimal idle hook will only get called if `configUSE_MINIMAL_IDLE_HOOK` is
set to `1` within `FreeRTOSConfig.h`. When this is set, the application must
provide the hook function with the following prototype:

```c
void vApplicationMinimalIdleHook( void ); 
```

The minimal idle hook is called repeatedly by the minimal idle tasks as
long as any one of them is running. **It is paramount that the minimal idle hook
function does not call any API functions that could cause it to block.**


## SMP Specific Configuration Options

These additional configuration options are available to the FreeRTOS-SMP Kernel:

* [configNUM\_CORES](#confignum_cores)
* [configRUN\_MULTIPLE\_PRIORITIES](#configrun_multiple_priorities)
* [configUSE\_CORE\_AFFINITY](#configuse_core_affinity)
* [configUSE\_TASK\_PREEMPTION\_DISABLE](#configuse_task_preemption_disable)


#### configNUM\_CORES

Sets the number of available processor cores.


#### configRUN\_MULTIPLE\_PRIORITIES

In a single core FreeRTOS application, a lower priority task will never run if
there is a higher priority task that is able to run. In an SMP FreeRTOS application
the RTOS kernel will run as many tasks as there are cores available - so it is possible
that a lower priority task will run on one core at the same time as a higher priority task
runs on another core. That can cause a problem if your application or library was
written for a single core environment, and so makes assumptions about the order in
which tasks execute. Therefore configRUN\_MULTIPLE\_PRIORITIES is provided to
control this behaviour.

If `configRUN_MULTIPLE_PRIORITIES` is defined as `0`, multiple tasks 
may run simultaneously only if they have equal priority - maintaining the paradigm of
a lower priority task never running if there is a higher priority task that is able to run. 
If `configRUN_MULTIPLE_PRIORITIES` is defined as `1`, multiple tasks 
with different priorities may run simultaneously - so a higher and lower priority task may run
on different cores at the same time.


#### configUSE\_CORE\_AFFINITY

Allows the application writer to control which cores a task can run on.
If `configUSE_CORE_AFFINITY` is defined as `1`, `vTaskCoreAffinitySet` 
can be used to control which cores a task can run on, and `vTaskCoreAffinityGet` can 
be used to query which cores a task can run on. If `configUSE_CORE_AFFINITY` is 0
then the FreeRTOS scheduler is free to run any task on any available core.


#### configUSE\_TASK\_PREEMPTION\_DISABLE

In a single core FreeRTOS application the FreeRTOS scheduler can be configured to
be either pre-emptive or co-operative. See the definition of configUSE\_PREEMPTION.
In SMP FreeRTOS application, if `configUSE_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE` is defined as `1`,
then individual tasks can be set to either pre-emptive or co-operative mode using the `vTaskPreemptionDisable`
and `vTaskPreemptionEnable` API functions.
