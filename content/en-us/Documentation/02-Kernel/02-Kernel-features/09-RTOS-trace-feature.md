[Also available: **FreeRTOS-Plus-Trace**, a third party trace tool for FreeRTOS - part of the FreeRTOS-Plus ecosystem](/Documentation/03-Libraries/02-FreeRTOS-plus/05-FreeRTOS_plus_Trace/00-FreeRTOS_Plus_Trace)


### Description

Trace hook macros are a very powerful feature that permit you to collect data on how your embedded application is behaving.

Key points of interest within the FreeRTOS source code contain empty macros that an application can re-define
for the purpose of providing application specific trace facilities. The application need only implement those macros
of particular interest - with unused macros remaining empty and therefore not impacting the application timing.


### Examples

Following are some examples of how these macros can be used:

* Setting a digital output to indicate which task is executing - allowing a logic analyzer to be used to
  view and record the task execution sequence and timing.
* Similarly - setting an analogue output to a voltage that represents which task is executing - allowing
  an oscilloscope to be used to view and record the task execution sequence and timing.
* Logging task execution sequences, task timing, RTOS kernel events and API calls for offline analysis.
* Integrating RTOS kernel events into third party debuggers.


#### Example 1

The FreeRTOS task tag functionality provides a simple mechanism for setting up logging via digital or analogue outputs. For
example, the tag value can be set to a voltage that is unique to that task.
The traceSWITCHED\_IN() macro can then be defined to simply set an analogue output to the value associated with the
task being switched in. For example:

```c
 /* First task sets its tag value to 1. */
void vTask1( void *pvParameters )
{
 /* This task is going to be represented by a voltage scale of 1. */
 vTaskSetApplicationTaskTag( NULL, ( void * ) 1 );

 for( ;; )
 {
 /* Task code goes here. */
 }
}
/*************************************************/

/* Second task sets its tag value to 2. */
void vTask2( void *pvParameters )
{
 /* This task is going to be represented by a voltage scale of 2. */
 vTaskSetApplicationTaskTag( NULL, ( void * ) 2 );

 for( ;; )
 {
 /* Task code goes here. */
 }
}
/*************************************************/

/* Define the traceTASK_SWITCHED_IN() macro to output the voltage associated
   with the task being selected to run on port 0. */
#define traceTASK_SWITCHED_IN() vSetAnalogueOutput( 0, (int)pxCurrentTCB->pxTaskTag )
```


#### Example 2

API call logging can be used to record the reason a context switch occurred. RTOS kernel call logging can
be used to record the sequence in which tasks execute. For example:

```c
/* traceBLOCKING_ON_QUEUE_RECEIVE() is just one of the macros that can be used to
record why a context switch is about to occur. */
#define traceBLOCKING_ON_QUEUE_RECEIVE(xQueue)
 ulSwitchReason = reasonBLOCKING_ON_QUEUE_READ;

/* log_event() is an application defined function that logs which tasks ran when,
   and why. */
#define traceTASK_SWITCHED_OUT()
 log_event( pxCurrentTCB, ulSwitchReason );
```


### Defining

Macros that are called from within interrupts, particularly the tick interrupt, must execute quickly and
not use much stack space. Setting variables, writing to trace registers, or outputting to ports are all
acceptable. Attempting to fprintf() log data to a slow disk will not work!

Macro definitions must occur before the inclusion of FreeRTOS.h. The easiest place to define trace macros
is at the bottom of FreeRTOSConfig.h, or in a separate header file that is included from the bottom of
FreeRTOSConfig.h.

The table below describes the available macros. The macro parameters are used to indicate which task, queue,
semaphore or mutex was associated with the event being recorded.
