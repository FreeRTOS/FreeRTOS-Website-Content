### FreeRTOS Queues

[See also [Blocking on Multiple RTOS Objects](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/07-Queue-sets/00-RTOS-queue-sets)]

Queues are the primary form of intertask communications. They can be used to send messages between tasks,
and between interrupts and tasks. In most cases they are used as thread safe FIFO (First In First Out)
buffers with new data being sent to the back of the queue, although data can also be sent to the front.

_Writing to and reading from a queue. In this example the queue was created to hold 5 items, and the
queue never becomes full._

### User Model: Maximum Simplicity, Maximum Flexibility . . .

The FreeRTOS queue usage model manages to combine simplicity with flexibility - attributes
that are normally mutually exclusive. Messages are sent through queues by copy, meaning
the data (which can be a pointer to larger buffers) is itself copied into the queue rather than the
queue always storing just a reference to the data. This is the best approach because:

- Small messages that are already contained in C variables (integers,
  small structures, etc.) can be sent into a queue directly. There is no
  need to allocate a buffer for the message and then copy the variable into
  the allocated buffer. Likewise, messages can be read from queues directly
  into C variables.

  Further, sending to a queue in this way allows the sending task
  to immediately overwrite the variable or buffer that was sent to the queue,
  even when the sent message remains in the queue.

  Because the data contained in the variable was copied into the queue the
  variable itself is available for re-use. There is no requirement for the
  task that sends the message and the task that receives the message to agree
  which task owns the message, and which task is responsible for freeing the
  message when it is no longer required.

- Using queues that pass data by copy does not prevent queues from being
  used to pass data by reference. When the size of a message reaches a point
  where it is not practical to copy the entire message into the queue byte
  for byte, define the queue to hold pointers and copy just a pointer to the
  message into the queue instead.

- The kernel takes complete responsibility for allocating the memory used
  as the queue storage area.

- Variable sized messages can be sent by defining queues to hold structures
  that contain a member that points to the queued message, and another
  member that holds the size of the queued message.

- A single queue can be used to receive different message types, and messages
  from multiple locations, by defining the queue to hold a structure that
  has a member that holds the message type, and another member that holds
  the message data (or a pointer to the message data). How the data is
  interpreted depends on the message type.

  This is exactly how the task that manages
  the [FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP](/Documentation/03-Libraries/02-FreeRTOS-plus/02-FreeRTOS-plus-TCP/01-FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP)
  IP stack is able to use a single queue to receive notifications of ARP timer events, packets
  being received from the Ethernet hardware, packets being received from
  the application, network down events, etc.

- The implementation is naturally suited for use in a memory protected
  environment. A task that is restricted to a protected memory area can
  pass data to a task that is restricted to a different protected memory
  area because invoking the RTOS by calling the queue send function will
  raise the microcontroller privilege level. The queue storage area is
  only accessed by the RTOS (with full privileges).

- A separate API is provided for use inside of an interrupt. Separating
  the API used from an RTOS task from that used from an interrupt service
  routine means the implementation of the RTOS API functions do not carry
  the overhead of checking their call context each time they execute.
  Using a separate interrupt API also means, in most cases, creating RTOS
  aware interrupt service routines is simpler for end users than when
  compared to alternative RTOS products.

- In every way, the API is simpler.

The [FreeRTOS tutorial book](/Documentation/02-Kernel/07-Books-and-manual/01-RTOS_book) provides additional information on queues, binary
semaphores, mutexes, counting semaphores and recursive semaphores, along with simple worked examples in
a set of accompanying example projects.

### Blocking on Queues

Queue API functions permit a block time to be specified.

When a task attempts to read from an empty queue the task will be placed into
the Blocked state (so it is not consuming any CPU time and other tasks can run)
until either data becomes available on the queue, or the block time expires.

When a task attempts to write to a full queue the task will be placed into
the Blocked state (so it is not consuming any CPU time and other tasks can run)
until either space becomes available in the queue, or the block time expires.

If more than one task block on the same queue then the task with the highest
priority will be the task that is unblocked first.

See the [Queue Management](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/06-Queues/00-QueueManagement) section of the user documentation for a list of queue related API
functions. Searching the files in the FreeRTOS/Demo/Common/Minimal directory will reveal multiple examples
of their usage.

Note that interrupts must NOT use API functions that do not end in "FromISR".
