semphr.h 

```c
xSemaphoreTakeRecursive( SemaphoreHandle_t xMutex,
                         TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```


*Macro* to recursively obtain, or 'take', a mutex type semaphore.
The mutex must have previously been created using a call to
xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex();

configUSE\_RECURSIVE\_MUTEXES must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for this
macro to be available.

This macro must not be used on mutexes created using xSemaphoreCreateMutex().

A mutex used recursively can be 'taken' repeatedly by the owner. The mutex
doesn't become available again until the owner has called
xSemaphoreGiveRecursive() for each successful 'take' request. For example,
if a task successfully 'takes' the same mutex 5 times then the mutex will
not be available to any other task until it has also 'given' the mutex back
exactly five times.


**Parameters:**

+ *xMutex* 

  A handle to the mutex being obtained. This is the handle returned by xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex().

+ *xTicksToWait* 

  The time in ticks to wait for the semaphore to become available. The macro portTICK\_PERIOD\_MS can 
  be used to convert this to a real time. A block time of zero can be used to poll the semaphore. If 
  the task already owns the semaphore then xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() will return immediately no matter 
  what the value of xTicksToWait.


**Returns:**

pdTRUE if the semaphore was obtained. pdFALSE if xTicksToWait expired without the semaphore becoming available.


**Example usage:**

```c
 SemaphoreHandle_t xMutex = NULL;

 // A task that creates a mutex.
 void vATask( void * pvParameters )
 {
    // Create the mutex to guard a shared resource.
    xMutex = xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex();
 }

 // A task that uses the mutex.
 void vAnotherTask( void * pvParameters )
 {
    // ... Do other things.

    if( xMutex != NULL )
    {
        // See if we can obtain the mutex. If the mutex is not available
        // wait 10 ticks to see if it becomes free. 
        if( xSemaphoreTakeRecursive( xMutex, ( TickType_t ) 10 ) == pdTRUE )
        {
            // We were able to obtain the mutex and can now access the
            // shared resource.

            // ...
            // For some reason due to the nature of the code further calls to 
            // xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() are made on the same mutex. In real
            // code these would not be just sequential calls as this would make
            // no sense. Instead the calls are likely to be buried inside
            // a more complex call structure.
            xSemaphoreTakeRecursive( xMutex, ( TickType_t ) 10 );
            xSemaphoreTakeRecursive( xMutex, ( TickType_t ) 10 );

            // The mutex has now been 'taken' three times, so will not be 
            // available to another task until it has also been given back
            // three times. Again it is unlikely that real code would have
            // these calls sequentially, but instead buried in a more complex
            // call structure. This is just for illustrative purposes.
            xSemaphoreGiveRecursive( xMutex );
            xSemaphoreGiveRecursive( xMutex );
            xSemaphoreGiveRecursive( xMutex );

            // Now the mutex can be taken by other tasks.
        }
        else
        {
            // We could not obtain the mutex and can therefore not access
            // the shared resource safely.
        }
    }
 }
```
