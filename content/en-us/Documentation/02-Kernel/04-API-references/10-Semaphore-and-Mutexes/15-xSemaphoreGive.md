[[Semaphores](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/10-Semaphore-and-Mutexes/00-Semaphores)]

[**TIP: In many usage scenarios it is faster and more memory efficient to use a direct to task notification instead of a semaphore**](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/03-Direct-to-task-notifications/01-Task-notifications)

semphr.h 

```c
xSemaphoreGive( SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore );
```

*Macro* to release a semaphore. The semaphore must have previously been
created with a call to `xSemaphoreCreateBinary()`, `xSemaphoreCreateMutex()` or `xSemaphoreCreateCounting()`.

This must not be used from an ISR. See `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` for an alternative which can be used from an ISR.

This macro must also not be used on semaphores created using `xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex()`.


**Parameters:**

- *xSemaphore*

  A handle to the semaphore being released. This is the handle returned when the semaphore was created. |


**Returns:**

- *pdTRUE* if the semaphore was released. 

- *pdFALSE* if an error occurred. Semaphores are implemented using queues. An error can occur if there is 
  no space on the queue to post a message - indicating that the semaphore was not first obtained correctly.


**Example usage:**

```c
SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;
void vATask( void * pvParameters )
{
    // Create the semaphore to guard a shared resource.  As we are using
    // the semaphore for mutual exclusion we create a mutex semaphore
    // rather than a binary semaphore.
    xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateMutex();

    if( xSemaphore != NULL )
    {
        if( xSemaphoreGive( xSemaphore ) != pdTRUE )
        {
            // We would expect this call to fail because we cannot give
            // a semaphore without first "taking" it!
        }
        // Obtain the semaphore - don't block if the semaphore is not
        // immediately available.
        if( xSemaphoreTake( xSemaphore, ( TickType_t ) 0 ) )
        {
            // We now have the semaphore and can access the shared resource.
            // ...
            // We have finished accessing the shared resource so can free the
            // semaphore.
            if( xSemaphoreGive( xSemaphore ) != pdTRUE )
            {
                // We would not expect this call to fail because we must have
                // obtained the semaphore to get here.
            }
        }
    }
}
```
