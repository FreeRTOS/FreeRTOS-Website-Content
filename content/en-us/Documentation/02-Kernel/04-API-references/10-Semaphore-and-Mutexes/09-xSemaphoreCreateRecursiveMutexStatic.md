[[Semaphores](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/10-Semaphore-and-Mutexes/00-Semaphores)]

semphr.h

```c
SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutexStatic(
                              StaticSemaphore_t *pxMutexBuffer )
```

Creates a [recursive mutex](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/02-Queues-mutexes-and-semaphores/05-Recursive-mutexes),
and returns a handle by which the mutex can be
referenced. Recursive mutexes cannot be used in interrupt service routines.
configUSE\_RECURSIVE\_MUTEXES and [configSUPPORT\_STATIC\_ALLOCATION](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization/#configsupport_static_allocation)
must both be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for
xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutexStatic() to be available.

Each recursive mutex require a small amount of RAM that is used to hold the
recursive mutex's state. If a mutex is created using [xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/10-Semaphore-and-Mutexes/08-xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex)
then the required RAM is automatically allocated from the [FreeRTOS heap](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/09-Memory-management/01-Memory-management).
If a recursive mutex is created using xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutexStatic()
then the RAM is provided by the application writer, which requires an additional
parameter, but allows the RAM to be statically allocated at compile
time. See the [Static Vs Dynamic allocation](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/09-Memory-management/03-Static-vs-Dynamic-memory-allocation) page for more information.

Recursive mutexes are 'taken' (obtained) using the [xSemaphoreTakeRecursive()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/10-Semaphore-and-Mutexes/14-xSemaphoreTakeRecursive) and
given (released) using the [xSemaphoreGiveRecursive()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/10-Semaphore-and-Mutexes/16-xSemaphoreGiveRecursive) API functions respectively.
xSemaphoreTake() and xSemaphoreGive() must not be used.

Non-recursive mutexes are created using xSemaphoreCreateMutex() and
xSemaphoreCreateMutexStatic(). A non-recursive mutex can only be 'taken' by a
task once. Any attempt by a task to take a non-recursive mutex that it already
holds will fail - and the mutex will always be given back the first time the
task 'gives' the mutex.

Contrary to non-recursive mutexes, a task can 'take' a recursive mutex multiple
times, and the recursive mutex will only be returned after the holding task has
'given' the mutex the same number of times it 'took' the mutex.

Like non-recursive mutexes, recursive mutexes implement a priority inheritance
algorithm. The priority of a task that 'takes' a mutex will be temporarily raised if another
task of higher priority attempts to obtain the same mutex. The task that owns
the mutex 'inherits' the priority of the task attempting to 'take' the same
mutex. This means the mutex must always be 'given' back - otherwise the higher
priority task will never be able to obtain the mutex, and the lower priority
task will never 'disinherit' the priority. For more on the priority inheritance 
mechanism see the [FreeRTOS Mutex documentation page](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/02-Queues-mutexes-and-semaphores/04-Mutexes)


**Parameters:**

+ *pxMutexBuffer*

  Must point to a variable of type StaticSemaphore\_t, which will be used to hold the mutex type semaphore's state.


**Return:**

If the recursive mutex was created successfully then a handle to the created mutex is returned. If the
recursive mutex was not created because pxMutexBuffer was NULL then NULL is returned.


**Example usage:**

```c
 SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;
 StaticSemaphore_t xMutexBuffer;

 void vATask( void * pvParameters )
 {
    /* Create a recursivemutex semaphore without using any dynamic
       memory allocation. The mutex's data structures will be saved into
       the xMutexBuffer variable. */
    xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutexStatic( &xMutexBuffer );

    /* The pxMutexBuffer was not NULL, so it is expected that the
       handle will not be NULL. */
    [configASSERT](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization/#configassert)( xSemaphore );

    /* Rest of the task code goes here. */
 }
```
