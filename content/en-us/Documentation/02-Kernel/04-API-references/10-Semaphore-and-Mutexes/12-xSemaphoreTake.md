[[Semaphores](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/10-Semaphore-and-Mutexes/00-Semaphores)]

[**TIP: In many usage scenarios it is faster and more memory efficient to use a direct to task notification instead of a semaphore**](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/03-Direct-to-task-notifications/01-Task-notifications)

semphr.h 

```c
 xSemaphoreTake( SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore,
                 TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```

*Macro* to obtain a semaphore. The semaphore must have previously been
created with a call to `xSemaphoreCreateBinary()`, `xSemaphoreCreateMutex()` or
`xSemaphoreCreateCounting()`.

This macro must not be called from an ISR. `xQueueReceiveFromISR()` can be used to take a semaphore from 
within an interrupt if required, although this would not be a normal operation. Semaphores use queues as 
their underlying mechanism, so functions are to some extent interoperable.


**Parameters:**

- *xSemaphore*

  A handle to the semaphore being taken - obtained when the semaphore was created.


- *xTicksToWait*

  The time in ticks to wait for the semaphore to become available. The macro `portTICK_PERIOD_MS` can 
  be used to convert this to a real time. A block time of zero can be used to poll the semaphore. 
  If [INCLUDE\_vTaskSuspend](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization) is set to '1' then specifying the block time as `portMAX_DELAY` 
  will cause the task to block indefinitely (without a timeout).


**Returns:**

- *pdTRUE* if the semaphore was obtained. 
- *pdFALSE* if `xTicksToWait` expired without the semaphore becoming available.


**Example usage:** 

```c
SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;

/* A task that creates a semaphore. */
void vATask( void * pvParameters )
{
    /* Create the semaphore to guard a shared resource. As we are using
       the semaphore for mutual exclusion we create a mutex semaphore
       rather than a binary semaphore. */
    xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateMutex();
}

/* A task that uses the semaphore. */
void vAnotherTask( void * pvParameters )
{
    /* ... Do other things. */

    if( xSemaphore != NULL )
    {
        /* See if we can obtain the semaphore. If the semaphore is not
           available wait 10 ticks to see if it becomes free. */
        if( xSemaphoreTake( xSemaphore, ( TickType_t ) 10 ) == pdTRUE )
        {
            /* We were able to obtain the semaphore and can now access the
               shared resource. */

            /* ... */

            /* We have finished accessing the shared resource. Release the
               semaphore. */
            xSemaphoreGive( xSemaphore );
        }
        else
        {
            /* We could not obtain the semaphore and can therefore not access
               the shared resource safely. */
        }
    }
}
```
