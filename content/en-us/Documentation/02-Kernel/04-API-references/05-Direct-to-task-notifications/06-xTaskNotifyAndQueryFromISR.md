```c
 BaseType_t xTaskNotifyAndQueryFromISR(
                      TaskHandle_t xTaskToNotify,
                      uint32_t ulValue,
                      eNotifyAction eAction,
                      uint32_t *pulPreviousNotifyValue,
                      BaseType_t *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken );

 BaseType_t xTaskNotifyAndQueryIndexedFromISR(
                      TaskHandle_t xTaskToNotify,
                      UBaseType_t uxIndexToNotify
                      uint32_t ulValue,

See [RTOS Task Notifications](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/03-Direct-to-task-notifications/01-Task-notifications) for more details.

xTaskNotifyAndQueryIndexedFromISR() performs the same operation
as [xTaskNotifyIndexedFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/07-xTaskNotifyFromISR) with the addition that it also returns the target
task's prior notification value (the notification value at the time the function is called rather than at
the time the function returns) in the additional pulPreviousNotifyValue parameter.

xTaskNotifyAndQueryFromISR() performs the same operation as [xTaskNotifyFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/07-xTaskNotifyFromISR)
with the addition that it also returns the target task's prior notification value (the notification value
at the time the function is called rather than at the time the function returns) in the additional
pulPreviousNotifyValue parameter.


**Parameters:**

* *xTaskToNotify*

  The handle of the RTOS task being notified. This is the *target* task. To obtain a task's handle create the task
  using [xTaskCreate()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/01-Task-creation/01-xTaskCreate) and make use of the pxCreatedTask parameter, or create the task
  using [xTaskCreateStatic()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/01-Task-creation/02-xTaskCreateStatic) and store the returned value, or use the task's name in a call
  to [xTaskGetHandle()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/03-Task-utilities/00-Task-utilities/#xtaskgethandle). The handle of the currently executing RTOS task is returned by
  the [xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/03-Task-utilities/00-Task-utilities/#xtaskgetcurrenttaskhandle) API function.

* *uxIndexToNotify*

  The index within the target task's array of notification values to which the notification is to be sent. uxIndexToNotify
  must be less than configTASK\_NOTIFICATION\_ARRAY\_ENTRIES.

* *ulValue*

  Used to update the notification value of the target task. See the description of the eAction parameter below.

* *eAction*

  An enumerated type that can take one of the values documented below in order to perform the associated action.

* *pulPreviousNotifyValue*

  Can be used to pass out the target task's notification value before any bits are modified by the action of
  xTaskNotifyAndQueryFromISR(). pulPreviousNotifyValue is an optional parameter, and can be set to NULL if it
  is not required. If pulPreviousNotifyValue is not used then consider using [xTaskNotify()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/04-xTaskNotify)
  in place of xTaskNotifyAndQueryFromISR().

* *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken*

  *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE (0). xTaskNotifyAndQueryFromISR() will set
  *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE if sending the notification caused a task to unblock, and the
  unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently running task. If xTaskNotifyAndQueryFromISR()
  sets this value to pdTRUE then a context switch should be requested before the interrupt is exited.
  See the example below. pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken is an optional parameter and can<br /> be set to NULL.


**eAction values and associated actions**

+ eNoAction

  The target task receives the event, but its<br /> notification value is not updated. In this case ulValue
  is not used.

+ eSetBits

  The notification value of the target task will be bitwise ORed with ulValue. For example, if ulValue
  is set to 0x01, then bit 0 will get set within the target task's notification value. Likewise if ulValue
  is 0x04 then bit 2 will get set in the target task's notification value. In this way the RTOS task
  notification mechanism can be used as a light weight alternative to an [event group](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/12-Event-groups-or-flags/00-Event-groups).

+ eIncrement

  The notification value of the target task will be incremented by one, making the call to xTaskNotify()
  equivalent to a call to [xTaskNotifyGive()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/01-xTaskNotifyGive). In this case ulValue is not used.

+ eSetValueWithOverwrite

  The notification value of the target task is unconditionally set to ulValue. In this way the RTOS task
  notification mechanism is being used as a light weight alternative to [xQueueOverwrite()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/06-Queues/11-xQueueOverwrite).

+ eSetValueWithoutOverwrite

  If the target task does not already have a notification pending then its notification value will be set
  to ulValue. If the target task already has a notification pending then its notification value is not
  updated as to do so would overwrite the previous value before it was used. In this case the call to
  xTaskNotify() fails and pdFALSE is returned. In this way the RTOS task notification mechanism is being
  used as a light weight alternative to [xQueueSend()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/06-Queues/03-xQueueSend) on a queue of length 1.


**Returns:**

pdPASS is returned in all cases other than when eAction is set to eSetValueWithoutOverwrite and the
target task's notification value cannot be updated because the target task already had a notification pending.


**Example usage:**

```c
void vAnISR( void )
{
/* Must be Initialised to pdFALSE! */
BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE.
uint32_t ulPreviousValue;

    /* Set bit 8 in the 0th notification value of the task referenced
       by xTask1Handle. Store the task's previous 0th notification value
       (before bit 8 is set) in ulPreviousValue. */
    xTaskNotifyAndQueryIndexedFromISR( xTask1Handle,
                                       0,
                                       ( 1UL << 8UL ),
                                       eSetBits,
                                       &ulPreviousValue,
                                       &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );

    /* The task's previous notification value is saved in
       ulPreviousValue. */

   /* If the task referenced by xTask1Handle was in the Blocked
      state, waiting for the notification, then it will now have been
      moved from the Blocked state to the Ready state. If its priority
      is higher than the priority of the currently executing task (the
      task this interrupt interrupted) then xHigherPriorityTaskWoken will
      have been set to pdTRUE, and passing the variable into a call to
      portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will result in the interrupt returning directly
      to the unblocked task. If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is still pdFALSE
      then passing it into portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will have no effect. */
    portYIELD_FROM_ISR( xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
}
```
