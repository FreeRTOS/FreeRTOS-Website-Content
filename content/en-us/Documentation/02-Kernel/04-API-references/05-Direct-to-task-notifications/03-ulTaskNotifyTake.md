[[RTOS Task Notification API](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/00-RTOS-task-notifications)]

task.h

```c
uint32_t ulTaskNotifyTake( BaseType_t xClearCountOnExit,
                           TickType_t xTicksToWait );
   
uint32_t ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed( UBaseType_t uxIndexToWaitOn, 
                                  BaseType_t xClearCountOnExit, 
                                  TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```

Each task has an array of 'task notifications' (or just 'notifications'), each
of which has a state and a 32-bit value. A [direct to task notification](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/03-Direct-to-task-notifications/01-Task-notifications) 
is an event sent directly to a task that can unblock the receiving task, and
optionally update one of the receiving task’s notification values in a number of different ways. 
For example, a notification may overwrite one of the receiving task's notification values, or just set one or 
more bits in one of the receiving task's notification values.

`ulTaskNotifyTake()` is a macro intended for use when a task notification 
is [used as a faster and lighter weight binary or counting semaphore](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/00-RTOS-task-notifications#uses) 
alternative. FreeRTOS semaphores are taken using the `xSemaphoreTake()` API function, `ulTaskNotifyTake()`
is the equivalent that uses a notification value in place of a semaphore.

`ulTaskNotifyTake()` and `ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed()` are equivalent macros - the only difference
being `ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed()` can operate on any task notification within the
array and `ulTaskNotifyTake()` always operates on the task notification at array index 0.

When a task is using a notification value as a binary or counting semaphore other tasks and interrupts 
should send notifications to it using either the [xTaskNotifyGive()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/01-xTaskNotifyGive) macro, or 
the [xTaskNotify()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/04-xTaskNotify) function with the function’s eAction parameter set to eIncrement (the 
two are equivalent).

`ulTaskNotifyTake()` can either clear the task’s notification value to zero on exit, in which case the 
notification value acts like a binary semaphore, or decrement the task’s notification value on exit, in 
which case the notification value acts more like a counting semaphore.

An RTOS task can use `ulTaskNotifyTake()` to [optionally] block to wait for a task’s notification value. 
The task does not consume any CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.

**Note:** Each notification within the array operates independently – a task can only block on one 
notification within the array at a time and will not be unblocked by a notification sent to any other 
array index.

Whereas [xTaskNotifyWait()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/05-Direct-to-task-notifications/08-xTaskNotifyWait) will return when a notification is pending, `ulTaskNotifyTake()` 
will return when the task’s notification value is not zero, decrementing the task’s notification value 
before it returns.

[configUSE\_TASK\_NOTIFICATIONS](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization/#configuse_task_notifications) must set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h (or 
be left undefined) for these macros to be available. The 
constant [configTASK\_NOTIFICATION\_ARRAY\_ENTRIES](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization/#configtask_notification_array_entries) 
sets the number of indexes in each task's array of task notifications.


**Backward compatibility information:**  

Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 each task had a single "notification value", and
all task notification API functions operated on that value. Replacing the
single notification value with an array of notification values necessitated a
new set of API functions that could address specific notifications within the
array. `ulTaskNotifyTake()` is the original API function, and remains backward
compatible by always operating on the notification value at index 0 in the
array. Calling `ulTaskNotifyTake()` is equivalent to calling
`ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed()` with the `uxIndexToWaitOn` parameter set to 0.


**Parameters:** 

- *uxIndexToWaitOn*

  The index within the calling task's array of notification values on which the calling task will wait 
  for a notification to be non-zero. `uxIndexToWaitOn` must be less than `configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES`. 
  
  `xTaskNotifyTake()` does not have this parameter and always waits for notifications on index 0.

- *xClearCountOnExit*

  If an RTOS task notification is received and `xClearCountOnExit` is set to `pdFALSE` then the RTOS task's 
  notification value is decremented before `ulTaskNotifyTake()` exits. This is equivalent to the value of a 
  counting semaphore being decremented by a successful call to `xSemaphoreTake()`. If an RTOS task notification 
  is received and `xClearCountOnExit` is set to `pdTRUE` then the RTOS task's notification value is reset 
  to 0 before `ulTaskNotifyTake()` exits. This is equivalent to the value of a binary semaphore being left
  at zero (or empty, or 'not available') after a successful call to `xSemaphoreTake()`.

- *xTicksToWait*

  The maximum time to wait in the Blocked state for a notification to be received if a notification is not 
  already pending when `ulTaskNotifyTake()` is called. The RTOS task does not consume any CPU time when it is 
  in the Blocked state. The time is specified in RTOS tick periods. The `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` macro can be used to 
  convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time specified in ticks.


**Returns:** 

 - The value of the task's notification value before it is decremented or
   cleared (see the description of `xClearCountOnExit`).
