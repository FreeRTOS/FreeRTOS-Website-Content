[[Event Group API](00-Event-groups)]

event\_groups.h

```c
EventBits_t xEventGroupWaitBits(
                      const EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup,
                      const EventBits_t uxBitsToWaitFor,
                      const BaseType_t xClearOnExit,
                      const BaseType_t xWaitForAllBits,
                      TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```

Read bits within an RTOS [event group](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/06-Event-groups), optionally entering the Blocked state (with a
timeout) to wait for a bit or group of bits to become set.

This function cannot be called from an interrupt.

The RTOS source file FreeRTOS/source/event\_groups.c must be
included in the build for the `xEventGroupWaitBits()` function to be available.


**Parameters:**

- *xEventGroup*

  The event group in which the bits are being tested. The event group must have previously been created
  using a call to [xEventGroupCreate()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/12-Event-groups-or-flags/01-xEventGroupCreate).

- *uxBitsToWaitFor*

  A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to test inside the event group. For example, to wait
  for bit 0 and/or bit 2 set `uxBitsToWaitFor` to 0x05. To wait for bits 0 and/or bit 1 and/or bit 2
  set `uxBitsToWaitFor` to 0x07. Etc. `uxBitsToWaitFor` must **not** be set to 0.

- *xClearOnExit*

  If `xClearOnExit` is set to `pdTRUE` then any bits set in the value passed as the `uxBitsToWaitFor`
  parameter will be cleared in the event group before `xEventGroupWaitBits()` returns if `xEventGroupWaitBits()`
  returns for any reason other than a timeout. The timeout value is set by the `xTicksToWait` parameter.
  If `xClearOnExit` is set to `pdFALSE` then the bits set in the event group are not altered when the call
  to `xEventGroupWaitBits()` returns.

- *xWaitForAllBits*

  `xWaitForAllBits` is used to create either a logical AND test (where all bits must be set) or a logical
  OR test (where one or more bits must be set) as follows:

  If `xWaitForAllBits` is set to `pdTRUE` then `xEventGroupWaitBits()` will return when either **all**
  the bits set in the value passed as the `uxBitsToWaitFor` parameter are set in the event group or the
  specified block time expires.

  If `xWaitForAllBits` is set to `pdFALSE` then `xEventGroupWaitBits()` will return when **any** of the
  bits set in the value passed as the `uxBitsToWaitFor` parameter are set in the event group or the specified
  block time expires.

- *xTicksToWait*

  The maximum amount of time (specified in 'ticks') to wait for one/all (depending on the `xWaitForAllBits`
  value) of the bits specified by `uxBitsToWaitFor` to become set.


**Returns:**

- The value of the event group at the time either the event bits being waited
  for became set, or the block time expired. The current value of the
  event bits in an event group will be different to the returned value if
  a higher priority task or interrupt changed the value of an event bit between the
  calling task leaving the Blocked state and exiting the `xEventGroupWaitBits()`
  function.

  Test the return value to know
  which bits were set. If `xEventGroupWaitBits()` returned because its timeout
  expired then not all the bits being waited for will be set. If
  `xEventGroupWaitBits()` returned because the bits it was waiting for were set
  then the returned value is the event group value before any bits were
  automatically cleared because the `xClearOnExit` parameter was set to `pdTRUE`.


**Example usage:**

```c
#define BIT_0	( 1 << 0 )
#define BIT_4	( 1 << 4 )

void aFunction( EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup )
{
    EventBits_t uxBits;
    const TickType_t xTicksToWait = 100 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS;

    /* Wait a maximum of 100ms for either bit 0 or bit 4 to be set within
       the event group. Clear the bits before exiting. */
    uxBits = xEventGroupWaitBits(
               xEventGroup,   /* The event group being tested. */
               BIT_0 | BIT_4, /* The bits within the event group to wait for. */
               pdTRUE,        /* BIT_0 & BIT_4 should be cleared before returning. */
               pdFALSE,       /* Don't wait for both bits, either bit will do. */
               xTicksToWait );/* Wait a maximum of 100ms for either bit to be set. */

    if( ( uxBits & ( BIT_0 | BIT_4 ) ) == ( BIT_0 | BIT_4 ) )
    {
        /* xEventGroupWaitBits() returned because both bits were set. */
    }
    else if( ( uxBits & BIT_0 ) != 0 )
    {
        /* xEventGroupWaitBits() returned because just BIT\_0 was set. */
    }
    else if( ( uxBits & BIT_4 ) != 0 )
    {
        /* xEventGroupWaitBits() returned because just BIT\_4 was set. */
    }
    else
    {
        /* xEventGroupWaitBits() returned because xTicksToWait ticks passed
           without either BIT\_0 or BIT\_4 becoming set. */
    }
}
```
