[[Timer API](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/00-FreeRTOS-Software-Timer-API-Functions/)]

timers.h

```c
 BaseType_t xTimerStart( TimerHandle_t xTimer,
                            TickType_t xBlockTime );
```

[Software timer](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/05-Software-timers/01-Software-timers) functionality is provided by a timer service/daemon task. Many of the
public FreeRTOS timer API functions send commands to the timer service task
through a queue called the timer command queue. The timer command queue is
private to the RTOS kernel itself and is not directly accessible to application
code. The length of the timer command queue is set by the `configTIMER_QUEUE_LENGTH` configuration constant.

`xTimerStart()` starts a timer that was previously created using the [xTimerCreate()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/01-xTimerCreate/)
API function. If the timer had already been started and was already in the active state,
then `xTimerStart()` has equivalent functionality to the [xTimerReset()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/08-xTimerReset) API function.

Starting a timer ensures the timer is in the active state. If the timer
is not stopped, deleted, or reset in the mean time, the callback function
associated with the timer will get called 'n' ticks after `xTimerStart()` was
called, where 'n' is the timers defined period.

It is valid to call `xTimerStart()` before the RTOS scheduler has been started, but
when this is done the timer will not actually start until the RTOS scheduler is
started, and the timers expiry time will be relative to when the RTOS scheduler is
started, not relative to when `xTimerStart()` was called.

The `configUSE_TIMERS` configuration constant must be set to 1 for `xTimerStart()`
 to be available.


**Parameters:**

- *xTimer*

  The handle of the timer being started/restarted.

- *xBlockTime*

  Specifies the time, in ticks, that the calling task should be held in the Blocked state to wait for
  the start command to be successfully sent to the timer command queue, should the queue already be
  full when `xTimerStart()` was called. `xBlockTime` is ignored if `xTimerStart()` is called before
  the RTOS scheduler is started.


**Returns:**

- `pdFAIL` will be returned if the start command could not be sent to
  the timer command queue even after `xBlockTime` ticks had passed.

- `pdPASS` will be returned if the command was successfully sent to the timer command queue.

  When the command is actually processed will depend on the priority of the
  timer service/daemon task relative to other tasks in the system, although the
  timers expiry time is relative to when `xTimerStart(`) is actually called. The
  timer service/daemon task priority is set by the `configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY`
  configuration constant.


**Example usage:**

See the example on the [xTimerCreate() documentation page](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/01-xTimerCreate/).
