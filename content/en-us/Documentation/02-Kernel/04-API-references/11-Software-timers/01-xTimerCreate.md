[[Timer API](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/00-FreeRTOS-Software-Timer-API-Functions/)]

timers.h

```c
 TimerHandle_t xTimerCreate
                 ( const char * const pcTimerName,
                   const TickType_t xTimerPeriod,
                   const UBaseType_t uxAutoReload,
                   void * const pvTimerID,
                   TimerCallbackFunction_t pxCallbackFunction );
```

Creates a new [software timer](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/05-Software-timers/01-Software-timers) instance and
returns a handle by which the timer can be referenced.

For this RTOS API function to be available:

1. configUSE\_TIMERS and [configSUPPORT\_DYNAMIC\_ALLOCATION](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization/#configsupport_dynamic_allocation)
   must both be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h (configSUPPORT\_DYNAMIC\_ALLOCATION
   can also be left undefined, in which case it will default to 1).

2. The FreeRTOS/Source/timers.c C source file must be included in the
   build.

Each software timer requires a small amount of RAM that is used to hold the
timer's state. If a timer is created using xTimerCreate() then this
RAM is automatically allocated from the [FreeRTOS heap](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/09-Memory-management/01-Memory-management).
If a software timer is created using [xTimerCreateStatic()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/22-xTimerCreateStatic)
then the RAM is provided by the application writer, which requires an additional
parameter, but allows the RAM to be statically allocated at compile
time. See the [Static Vs Dynamic allocation](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/09-Memory-management/03-Static-vs-Dynamic-memory-allocation) page for more information.

Timers are created in the dormant state. The [xTimerStart()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/04-xTimerStart),
[xTimerReset()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/08-xTimerReset), [xTimerStartFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/09-xTimerStartFromISR),
[xTimerResetFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/12-xTimerResetFromISR), [xTimerChangePeriod()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/06-xTimerChangePeriod), and [xTimerChangePeriodFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/11-xTimerChangePeriodFromISR)
 API functions can all be used to transition a timer into the active state.


**Parameters:**

- *pcTimerName*

  A human readable text name that is assigned to the timer. This is done purely to assist debugging.
  The RTOS kernel itself only ever references a timer by its handle, and never by its name.

- *xTimerPeriod*

  The period of the timer. The period is specified in ticks, and the macro pdMS\_TO\_TICKS() can be used
  to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time specified in ticks. For example, if the timer must
  expire after 100 ticks, then simply set xTimerPeriod to 100. Alternatively, if the timer must expire after
  500ms, then set xTimerPeriod to pdMS\_TO\_TICKS( 500 ). pdMS\_TO\_TICKS() can only be used
  if [configTICK\_RATE\_HZ](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization/#configtick_rate_hz) is less than or equal to 1000. The timer period
  must be greater than 0.

- *uxAutoReload*

  If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE, then the timer will expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the
  xTimerPeriod parameter. If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE, then the timer will be a one-shot and enter
  the dormant state after it expires.

- *pvTimerID*

  An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created. Typically this would be used in the timer
  callback function to identify which timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more
  than one timer, or together with the [vTimerSetTimerID()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/15-vTimerSetTimerID)
   and [pvTimerGetTimerID()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/13-pvTimerGetTimerID) API functions to save a value between
  calls to the timer's callback function.

- *pxCallbackFunction*

  The function to call when the timer expires. Callback functions must have the prototype defined by
  TimerCallbackFunction\_t, which is:

  ```c
  void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t xTimer );
  ```

**Returns:**

- If the timer is created successfully then a handle to the newly
  created timer is returned. If the timer cannot be created because
  there is insufficient FreeRTOS heap remaining to allocate the timer
  structures then NULL is returned.


**Example usage:**

```c
 #define NUM_TIMERS 5

 /* An array to hold handles to the created timers. */
 TimerHandle_t xTimers[ NUM_TIMERS ];

 /* Define a callback function that will be used by multiple timer
    instances. The callback function does nothing but count the number
    of times the associated timer expires, and stop the timer once the
    timer has expired 10 times. The count is saved as the ID of the
    timer. */
 void vTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t xTimer )
 {
 const uint32_t ulMaxExpiryCountBeforeStopping = 10;
 uint32_t ulCount;

    /* Optionally do something if the pxTimer parameter is NULL. */
    configASSERT( xTimer );

    /* The number of times this timer has expired is saved as the
       timer's ID. Obtain the count. */
    ulCount = ( uint32_t ) pvTimerGetTimerID( xTimer );

    /* Increment the count, then test to see if the timer has expired
       ulMaxExpiryCountBeforeStopping yet. */
    ulCount++;

    /* If the timer has expired 10 times then stop it from running. */
    if( ulCount >= ulMaxExpiryCountBeforeStopping )
    {
        /* Do not use a block time if calling a timer API function
           from a timer callback function, as doing so could cause a
           deadlock! */
        xTimerStop( xTimer, 0 );
    }
    else
    {
       /* Store the incremented count back into the timer's ID field
          so it can be read back again the next time this software timer
          expires. */
       vTimerSetTimerID( xTimer, ( void * ) ulCount );
    }
 }
