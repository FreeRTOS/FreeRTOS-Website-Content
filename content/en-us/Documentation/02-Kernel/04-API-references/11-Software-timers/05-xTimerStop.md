[[Timer API](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/00-FreeRTOS-Software-Timer-API-Functions/)]

timers.h

```c
 BaseType_t xTimerStop( TimerHandle_t xTimer,
                        TickType_t xBlockTime );
```

[Software timer](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/05-Software-timers/01-Software-timers) functionality is provided by a timer service/daemon task. Many of the
public FreeRTOS timer API functions send commands to the timer service task
through a queue called the timer command queue. The timer command queue is
private to the RTOS kernel itself and is not directly accessible to application
code. The length of the timer command queue is set by the
configTIMER\_QUEUE\_LENGTH configuration constant.

xTimerStop() stops a timer that was previously started using either of the
 [xTimerStart()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/04-xTimerStart),
 [xTimerReset()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/08-xTimerReset),
 [xTimerStartFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/09-xTimerStartFromISR),
 [xTimerResetFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/12-xTimerResetFromISR),
 [xTimerChangePeriod()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/06-xTimerChangePeriod),
 and [xTimerChangePeriodFromISR()](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/11-xTimerChangePeriodFromISR) API functions.

Stopping a timer ensures the timer is not in the active state.

The `configUSE_TIMERS` configuration constant must be set to 1 for xTimerStop()
to be available.


**Parameters:**

- *xTimer*

  The handle of the timer being stopped.

- *xBlockTime*

  Specifies the time, in ticks, that the calling task should be held in the Blocked state to wait for the stop
  command to be successfully sent to the timer command queue, should the queue already be full when `xTimerStop()`
  was called. `xBlockTime` is ignored if `xTimerStop()` is called before the RTOS scheduler is started.


**Returns:**

- *pdFAIL*

  `pdFAIL` will be returned if the stop command could not be sent to the timer command queue even after
  xBlockTime ticks had passed.

- *pdPASS*

  `pdPASS` will be returned if the command was successfully sent to the timer command queue.
  When the command is actually processed will depend on the priority of the
  timer service/daemon task relative to other tasks in the system. The
  timer service/daemon task priority is set by the `configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY`
  configuration constant.


**Example usage:**

See the example on the [xTimerCreate() documentation page](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/11-Software-timers/01-xTimerCreate/).
