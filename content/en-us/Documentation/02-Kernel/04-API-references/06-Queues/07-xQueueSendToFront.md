[[Queue Management](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/06-Queues/00-QueueManagement)]


queue.h 

```c
 BaseType_t xQueueSendToFront( QueueHandle_t xQueue,
 const void * pvItemToQueue,
 TickType_t xTicksToWait );
``` 

This is a macro that calls xQueueGenericSend().

Post an item to the front of a queue. The item is queued by copy, not by
reference. This function must not be called from an interrupt service
routine. See xQueueSendToFrontFromISR () for an alternative which may be used
in an ISR.


**Parameters:**

+ *xQueue* 

  The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.

+ *pvItemToQueue* 

  A pointer to the item that is to be placed on the queue. The size of the items the queue will hold 
  was defined when the queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from pvItemToQueue into the 
  queue storage area

+ *xTicksToWait* 

  The maximum amount of time the task should block waiting for space to become available on the queue, 
  should it already be full. The call will return immediately if this is set to 0. The time is defined 
  in tick periods so the constant portTICK\_PERIOD\_MS should be used to convert to real time if this is 
  required. 

  If [INCLUDE\_vTaskSuspend](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization) is set to '1' then specifying the block time as portMAX\_DELAY 
  will cause the task to block indefinitely (without a timeout). |


**Returns:**

pdPASS if the item was successfully posted, otherwise errQUEUE\_FULL.


**Example usage:**

```c
struct AMessage
{
    char ucMessageID;
    char ucData[ 20 ];
} xMessage;

unsigned long ulVar = 10UL;

void vATask( void *pvParameters )
{
QueueHandle_t xQueue1, xQueue2;
struct AMessage *pxMessage;

    /* Create a queue capable of containing 10 unsigned long values. */
    xQueue1 = xQueueCreate( 10, sizeof( unsigned long ) );

    /* Create a queue capable of containing 10 pointers to AMessage
       structures. These should be passed by pointer as they contain a lot of
       data. */
    xQueue2 = xQueueCreate( 10, sizeof( struct AMessage * ) );

    /* ... */

    if( xQueue1 != 0 )
    {
        /* Send an unsigned long. Wait for 10 ticks for space to become
           available if necessary. */
        if( xQueueSendToFront( xQueue1,
                              ( void * ) &ulVar,
                              ( TickType_t ) 10 ) != pdPASS )
        {
            /* Failed to post the message, even after 10 ticks. */
        }
    }

    if( xQueue2 != 0 )
    {
        /* Send a pointer to a struct AMessage object. Don't block if the
           queue is already full. */
        pxMessage = & xMessage;
        xQueueSendToFront( xQueue2, ( void * ) &pxMessage, ( TickType_t ) 0 );
    }

	/* ... Rest of task code. */
}
```
