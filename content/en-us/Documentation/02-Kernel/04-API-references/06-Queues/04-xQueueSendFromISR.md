queue.h 

```c
BaseType_t xQueueSendFromISR(
                              QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                              const void *pvItemToQueue,
                              BaseType_t *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken
                            );
```
 
This is a macro that calls `xQueueGenericSendFromISR()`. It is included
for backward compatibility with versions of FreeRTOS that did not
include the `xQueueSendToBackFromISR()` and `xQueueSendToFrontFromISR()`
macros.

Post an item into the back of a queue. It is safe to use this function from within an interrupt service routine.

Items are queued by copy not reference so it is preferable to only queue small items, especially when called from
an ISR. In most cases it would be preferable to store a pointer to the item being queued.


**Parameters:**

- *xQueue*

  The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.

- *pvItemToQueue*

  A pointer to the item that is to be placed on the queue. The size of the items the queue will hold was 
  defined when the queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from `pvItemToQueue` into the queue 
  storage area.

- *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken*

  `xQueueSendFromISR()` will set `*pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken` to `pdTRUE` if sending to the queue caused 
  a task to unblock, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently running task. 
  If `xQueueSendFromISR()` sets this value to `pdTRUE` then a context switch should be requested before 
  the interrupt is exited. From FreeRTOS V7.3.0 `pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken` is an optional parameter 
  and can be set to NULL.


**Returns:**

- *pdPASS* if the data was successfully sent to the queue, 
- *errQUEUE\_FULL* otherwise.

Example usage for buffered IO (where the ISR can obtain more than one value per call): 

```c
void vBufferISR( void )
{
    char cIn;
    BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken;

    /* We have not woken a task at the start of the ISR. */
    xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;

    /* Loop until the buffer is empty. */
    do
    {
        /* Obtain a byte from the buffer. */
        cIn = portINPUT_BYTE( RX_REGISTER_ADDRESS );

       /* Post the byte. */
       xQueueSendFromISR( xRxQueue, &cIn, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );

    } while( portINPUT_BYTE( BUFFER_COUNT ) );

    /* Now the buffer is empty we can switch context if necessary. */
    if( xHigherPriorityTaskWoken )
    {
        /* Actual macro used here is port specific. */
        taskYIELD_FROM_ISR ();
    }
}
```
