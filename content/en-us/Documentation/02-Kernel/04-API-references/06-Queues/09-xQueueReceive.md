[[Queue Management](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/06-Queues/00-QueueManagement)]

queue.h 

```c
BaseType_t xQueueReceive(
                          QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                          void *pvBuffer,
                          TickType_t xTicksToWait
);
```
 
This is a macro that calls the `xQueueGenericReceive()` function.

Receive an item from a queue. The item is received by copy so a buffer of adequate size must be provided. 
The number of bytes copied into the buffer was defined when the queue was created.

This function must not be used in an interrupt service routine. See xQueueReceiveFromISR for an alternative 
that can.

**Parameters:**

- *xQueue*

  The handle to the queue from which the item is to be received.
  
- *pvBuffer*

  Pointer to the buffer into which the received item will be copied.
  
- *xTicksToWait*

  The maximum amount of time the task should block waiting for an item to receive should the queue be 
  empty at the time of the call. Setting `xTicksToWait` to 0 will cause the function to return immediately 
  if the queue is empty. The time is defined in tick periods so the constant `portTICK_PERIOD_MS` should 
  be used to convert to real time if this is required. If [INCLUDE\_vTaskSuspend](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization) is set to '1' 
  then specifying the block time as `portMAX_DELAY` will cause the task to block indefinitely (without 
  a timeout).


**Returns:**

- *pdPASS* if an item was successfully received from the queue, 
- *errQUEUE\_EMPTY* otherwise.


**Example usage:**

```c
/* Define a variable of type struct AMMessage. The examples below demonstrate
   how to pass the whole variable through the queue, and as the structure is
   moderately large, also how to pass a reference to the variable through a queue. */
struct AMessage

    /* Create the queue used to send complete struct AMessage structures. This can
       also be created after the schedule starts, but care must be task to ensure
       nothing uses the queue until after it has been created. */

        /* The number of items the queue can hold. */
        10,

        /* Size of each item is big enough to hold only a pointer. */

                   was sent to the queue successfully. */
