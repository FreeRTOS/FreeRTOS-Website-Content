[[Queue Management](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/06-Queues/00-QueueManagement)]

queue.h 

```c
void vQueueAddToRegistry(
                          QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                          char *pcQueueName,
                        );
```

Assigns a name to a queue and adds the queue to the registry.


**Parameters:**

- *xQueue*

  The handle of the queue being added to the registry.
  
- *pcQueueName*

  The name to be assigned to the queue. This is just a text string used to facilitate debugging. The 
  queue registry only stores a pointer to the string, so the string must be persistent (a global, or 
  preferably in ROM/Flash), not defined on the stack.


The queue registry has two purposes, both of which are associated with RTOS kernel aware debugging:

1. It allows a textual name to be associated with a queue for easy queue identification within a debugging GUI.
2. It contains the information required by a debugger to locate each registered queue and semaphore.

The queue registry has no purpose unless you are using a RTOS kernel aware debugger.

`configQUEUE_REGISTRY_SIZE` defines the maximum number of queues and semaphores that can be registered.
Only the queues and semaphores that you want to view using a RTOS kernel aware debugger need to be registered.


### Example 

```c
void vAFunction( void )
{
    QueueHandle_t xQueue;

    /* Create a queue big enough to hold 10 chars. */
    xQueue = xQueueCreate( 10, sizeof( char ) );

    /* We want this queue to be viewable in a RTOS kernel aware debugger,
       so register it. */
    vQueueAddToRegistry( xQueue, "AMeaningfulName" );
}
```
