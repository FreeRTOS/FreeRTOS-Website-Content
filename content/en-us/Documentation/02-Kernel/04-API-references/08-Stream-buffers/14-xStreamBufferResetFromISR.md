[[RTOS Stream Buffer API](/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/08-Stream-buffers/00-RTOS-stream-buffer-API)]


stream\_buffer.h

```c
BaseType_t xStreamBufferResetFromISR( StreamBufferHandle_t xStreamBuffer );
```

An interrupt safe version of the xStreamBufferReset() API function.

Resets a [stream buffer](/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/04-Stream-and-message-buffers/02-Stream-buffer-example) 
to its initial, empty, state. Any data that was in the stream buffer is discarded. A stream buffer can 
only be reset if there are no tasks blocked waiting to either send to or receive from the stream buffer.

Use `xStreamBufferReset()` to reset a stream buffer from a task. Use `xStreamBufferResetFromISR()` to 
reset a stream buffer from an interrupt service routine (ISR).

Stream buffer functionality is enabled by including the FreeRTOS/source/stream_buffer.c source file in 
the build.


**Parameters:**

+ `xStreamBuffer`

  The handle of the stream buffer to reset.


**Returns:**

+ If the stream buffer is reset then pdPASS is returned. 
+ If there was a task blocked waiting to send to or read from the stream buffer then the stream buffer 
  will not be reset and pdFAIL is returned.
