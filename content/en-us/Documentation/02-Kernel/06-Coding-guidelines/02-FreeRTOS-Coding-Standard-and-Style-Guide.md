### Coding Standard / MISRA C:2012 Compliance

The core FreeRTOS source files (those that are common to all ports, but not the port layer) conform to
the [MISRA](http://www.misra.org.uk/) coding standard guidelines. Compliance is checked
using [Coverity](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/static-analysis-tools-sast/coverity.html)
with the [coverity MISRA configuration file](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/examples/coverity/coverity_misra.config).
As the standard is many pages long, and is available for purchase from MISRA for a very small fee, we
have not replicated all the rules here. Deviations from the MISRA standard are listed in
this [document](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/MISRA.md).

FreeRTOS builds with many different compilers, some of which are more advanced than others. For that
reason FreeRTOS does not use any of the features or syntax that have been introduced to the C language
by, or since, the C99 standard. The one exception to this is the use of the `stdint.h` header file.
The `FreeRTOS/Source/include` directory contains a file called `stdint.readme` that can be renamed `stdint.h`
to provide the minimum stdint type definitions necessary to build FreeRTOS - should your compiler not
provide its own.

### Coding Standard / MISRA C:2004 Compliance ( FreeRTOS Kernel versions earlier than 11.0.0 )

MISRA C:2004 compliance for FreeRTOS Kernel versions earlier than 11.0.0 is checked
using [pc-lint](https://pclintplus.com/) with
the [linked lint configuration files](/media/lint_configuration.zip).

Deviations from the MISRA standard are listed below:

* Two API functions have more than one exit point. A deviation was permitted in these two cases for reasons
  of critical efficiency.

* When creating tasks, the source code manipulates memory addresses to locate the start and end addresses of
  the stack allocated to the created task. The code has to work for all the architectures to which FreeRTOS
  has been ported - which includes architectures with 8, 16, 20, 24 and 32-bit buses. This inevitably requires
  some pointer arithmetic. When pointer arithmetic is used, the arithmetic result is programmatically checked
  for correctness.

* The trace macros are, by default, empty, so they do not generate any code. Therefore, MISRA compliance checking
  is performed with dummy macro definitions.

* MISRA rules are turned off on a line by line basis, as deemed appropriate (that is, when complying with the rule
  is deemed to create less appropriate code for a deeply embedded system than carefully not complying). Each such
  occurrence is accompanied by a justification using the special pc-lint MISRA comment mark-up syntax.

### Testing

This section describes the tests performed on common code (the
code [located in the FreeRTOS/Source directory](/Documentation/02-Kernel/06-Coding-guidelines/01-Source-code-organization/)
that is built by all FreeRTOS kernel ports), and the tests performed on the portable layer code (the
code located in subdirectories of the FreeRTOS/Source/portable directory).

* **Common code**

  The standard demo/test files attempt to provide 'branch' test coverage whereby the tests ensure both 'true' and 'false'
  paths through each decision are exercised. (In most cases this actually
  achieves ['condition' coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) because the kernel's coding style
  deliberately keeps conditions simple, specifically for this purpose.) 'branch' coverage is measured using GCOV by
  defining the mtCOVERAGE\_TEST\_MARKER() macro to a NOP (no operation) instruction in the 'else' path of each 'if()'
  condition if the 'else' path would otherwise be empty. mtCOVERAGE\_TEST\_MARKER() is only defined while measuring
  test coverage - normally it is an empty macro that does not generate any code.

* **Port layer**

  Port layer code is tested using 'reg test' tasks, and, for ports that support interrupt nesting,
  the 'interrupt queue' tasks.

  The 'reg test' tasks create multiple (normally two) tasks that first fill all the CPU registers with known values,
  then continuously check that every register maintains its expected known value as the other tests execute
  continuously (soak test). Each reg test task uses unique values.

  The 'interrupt queue' tasks perform tests on interrupts of different priorities that nest at least three deep. Macros
  are used to insert artificial delays into pertinent points within the code to ensure the desired test coverage is achieved.

**It is worth noting that the thoroughness of these tests has been responsible for finding bugs in silicon on multiple occasions.**

### Memory Safety Proofs

[FreeRTOS Core](/Documentation/03-Libraries/03-FreeRTOS-core/01-Introduction) (and [FreeRTOS for AWS IoT](/Documentation/03-Libraries/04-AWS-libraries/01-Introduction))
libraries include [memory safety proofs](/Community/Blogs/2020/ensuring-the-memory-safety-of-freertos-part-1).
The same proofs are being applied to the FreeRTOS kernel and FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP stack, but these two older
libraries do not have full coverage yet.

### Security Review

Non trivial updates must pass Applied Security (APSEC) review and penetration testing (pentesting) prior to
release (services provided by AWS).


---

### Naming Conventions

The RTOS kernel and demo application source code use the following conventions:

* Variables
	+ Variables of type *uint32\_t* are prefixed *ul*, where the 'u' denotes 'unsigned' and the 'l' denotes 'long'.
	+ Variables of type *uint16\_t* are prefixed *us*, where the 'u' denotes 'unsigned' and the 's' denotes 'short'.
	+ Variables of type *uint8\_t* are prefixed *uc*, where the 'u' denotes 'unsigned' and the 'c' denotes 'char'.
	+ Variables of non stdint types are prefixed *x*. Examples include BaseType\_t and TickType\_t, which are
	  portable layer defined typedefs for the type that is the natural or most efficient type for the architecture,
	  and the type used to hold the RTOS tick count, respectively.
	+ Unsigned variables of non stdint types have an additional prefix *u*. For example, variables of type
	  UBaseType\_t (unsigned BaseType\_t) are prefixed *ux*.
	+ Variables of type *size\_t* are also prefixed *ux*.
	+ Enumerated variables are prefixed *e*
	+ Pointers have an additional *p* prefixed, for example, a pointer to a uint16\_t will have prefix *pus*.
	+ In line with MISRA guides, unqualified standard *char* types are only permitted to hold ASCII characters and
	  are prefixed *c*.
	+ In line with MISRA guides, variables of type *char ** are only permitted to hold pointers to ASCII strings
	  and are prefixed *pc*.

* Functions
	+ File scope static (private) functions are prefixed with *prv*.
	+ API functions are prefixed with their return type, as per the convention defined for variables with the
	  addition of the prefix *v* for *void*.
	+ API function names start with the name of the file in which they are defined. For example vTaskDelete is
	  defined in tasks.c, and has a void return type.

* Macros
	+ Macros are prefixed with the file in which they are defined. The pre-fix is lower case. For example,
	  configUSE\_PREEMPTION is defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
	+ Other than the prefix, macros are written in all upper case, and use an underscore to separate words.

### Data Types

Only stdint.h types and the RTOS's own typedefs are used, with the following exceptions:

* char

  In line with MISRA guides, unqualified char types are permitted, but only when they are used to hold ASCII characters.

* char \*

  In line with MISRA guides, unqualified character pointers are permitted, but only when they are used to point to
  ASCII strings. This removes the need to suppress benign compiler warnings when standard library functions that
  expect char * parameters are used, especially considering some compilers default unqualified char types to be
  signed while other compilers default unqualified char types to be unsigned.


There are four types that are defined for each port. These are:

* TickType\_t

  + If configUSE\_16\_BIT\_TICKS is set to non-zero (true), then TickType\_t is defined to be an unsigned 16-bit type.
  + If configUSE\_16\_BIT\_TICKS is set to zero (false), then TickType\_t is defined to be an unsigned 32-bit type.

  See the [customization](/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/02-Customization/) section of the API documentation
  for full information.

  32-bit architectures should always set configUSE\_16\_BIT\_TICKS to 0.

* BaseType\_t

  This is defined to be the most efficient, natural type for the architecture. For example, on a 32-bit architecture,
  BaseType\_t will be defined to be a 32-bit type. On a 16-bit architecture, BaseType\_t will be defined to be a 16-bit
  type. If BaseType\_t is defined to char, then particular care must be taken to ensure signed chars are used for
  function return values that can be negative to indicate an error.

* UBaseType\_t

  This is an unsigned BaseType\_t.

* StackType\_t

  Defined to the type used by the architecture for items stored on the stack. Normally this would be a 16-bit type
  on 16-bit architectures and a 32-bit type on 32-bit architectures, although there are some exceptions. Used
  internally by FreeRTOS.

### Style Guide

* Indentation

  Four space characters are used to indent.

* Comments

  Comments never pass column 80, unless they follow, and describe, a parameter.

  C++ style double slash (//) comments are not used.

* Layout

  The FreeRTOS source code layout is designed to be as easy to view and read as possible. The code snippets below
  show first the file layout, then the C code formatting.

  ```c
  /* Library includes come first... */

  #include <stdlib.h>
  /* ...followed by FreeRTOS includes... */
  #include "FreeRTOS.h"
  /* ...followed by other includes. */
  #include "HardwareSpecifics.h"
  /* #defines come next, bracketed where possible. */
  #define A_DEFINITION	( 1 )

  /*
   * Static (file private) function prototypes appear next, with comments
   * in this style - each line starting with a '*'.
   */
  static void prvAFunction( uint32_t ulParameter );

  /* File scope variables are the last thing before the function definitions.
  Comments for variables are in this style (without each line starting with
  a '*'). */
  static BaseType_t xMyVariable;

  /* The following separator is used after the closing bracket of each function,
  with a blank line following it before the start of the next function definition. */

  /*-----------------------------------------------------------*/

  void vAFunction( void )
  {
    /* Function definition goes here - note the separator after the closing
    curly bracket. */
  }

  /*-----------------------------------------------------------*/

  static UBaseType_t prvNextFunction( void )
  {
    /* Function definition goes here. */
  }

  /*-----------------------------------------------------------*/
  ```
  *File Layout*

  ```c
  /* Function names are always written on a single line, including the return
     type. As always, there is no space before the opening parenthesis. There
     is a space after an opening parenthesis. There is a space before a closing
     parenthesis. There is a space after each comma. Parameters are given
     verbose, descriptive names (unlike this example!). The opening and closing
     curly brackets appear on their own lines, lined up underneath each other. */
  void vAnExampleFunction( long lParameter1, unsigned short usParameter2 )
  {
  /* Variable declarations are not indented. */
  uint8_t ucByte;

      /* Code is indented. Curly brackets are always on their own lines
      and lined up underneath each other. */
      for( ucByte = 0U; ucByte < fileBUFFER_LENGTH; ucByte++ )
      {
          /* Indent again. */
      }
  }

  /* For, while, do and if constructs follow a similar pattern. There is no
     space before the opening parenthesis. There is a space after an opening
     parenthesis. There is a space before a closing parenthesis. There is a
     space after each semicolon (if there are any). There are spaces before and
     after each operator. No reliance is placed on operator precedence -
     parenthesis are always used to make precedence explicit. Magic numbers,
     other than zero, are always replaced with a constant or #defined constant.
     The opening and closing curly brackets appear on their own lines. */
  for( ucByte = 0U; ucByte < fileBUFFER_LENGTH; ucByte++ )
  {
  }

  while( ucByte < fileBUFFER_LENGTH )
  {
  }

  /* There must be no reliance on operator precedence - every condition in a
     multi-condition decision must uniquely be bracketed, as must all
     sub-expressions. */
  if( ( ucByte < fileBUFFER_LENGTH ) && ( ucByte != 0U ) )
  {
      /* Example of no reliance on operator precedence! */
      ulResult = ( ( ulValue1 + ulValue2 ) - ulValue3 ) * ulValue4;
  }

  /* Conditional compilations are laid out **and indented** as per any
     other code. */
  #if( configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY == 1 )
  {
      /* Add a counter into the TCB for tracing only. */
      pxNewTCB->uxTCBNumber = uxTaskNumber;
  }
  #endif

  /* A space is placed after an opening square bracket, and before a closing
     square bracket. */
  ucBuffer[ 0 ] = 0U;
  ucBuffer[ fileBUFFER_LENGTH - 1U ] = 0U;
  ```
